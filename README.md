# CircuitBoardTutorial
This tutorial describes how to create your very own printed circuit board (PCB) using the tools in Art & Technology Studies ioLab at the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago](www.saic.edu).  Here's what we will cover in this tut:
1. Using [Fritzing](www.fritzing.org) to design the PCB for your project.
2. Exporting and preparing that design for the circuit board mill.
3. Setting up the mill and running a mill job.
4. Finishing your PCB and preparing to put it into use.

For this project, I will assume that you already have [downloaded](fritzing.org/download) Fritzing.some electronics experience and that you're proficient at breadboarding a circuit, soldering, and checking continuity with a multimeter.  I will be going over some basic editing and design in Fritzing, but there are many more in-depth tutorials over at http://fritzing.org/learning/.

Ok, let's get started!!
## 1. Using Fritzing to design the PCB.
If you're ready to design and fabricate a PCB, that usually means that you have already worked out your circuit on a breadboard.  You may even have soldered up one or two of said circuit on a protoboard. A dedicated PCB can save you space and keep you from having to solder a million jumpers all over your protoboard.  For this tutorial, we're going to use a modified version of the [555 Timer LED Flasher](http://fritzing.org/projects/555-timer-led-flasher) from Fritzing's projects page.  The astable 555 circuit is a oldy and a goody and it will show some of the features of that can make a PCB more desireable than a protoboard.  [Here](www.noahcoleman.net) is the Fritzing file we'll be using for our version.
